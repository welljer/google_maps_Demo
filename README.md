# Google Maps API Demo
Simple project to show how to use Google Maps API as a means to understand the uses of APIs in real world scenarios
* Disclaimer:
This project is hard coded with a specific location for example purposes, due to respect for security.

# API 
* **What does the API acronym stand for?**
    * API stands for _Application Programming Interface_
* **What does this mean?**
    * The simplest terms would be to phrase it as _"An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. Lately though, the term API is most often used to describe a particular kind of web interface."_
* **Why use APIs?**
    * In order to innovate faster, developers need access to reusable components such as APIs, templates, etc. that allow them to discover, connect and reuse software assets. APIs, in particular, act like messengers running back and forth between applications, databases and devices––making it easy for companies to unlock data within existing systems and connect that data to other relevant systems.    
* **What are some of the most commonly used APIs**

2. [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/) 
3. [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
